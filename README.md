# OAuth2 with Github and ASP.NET Core 3

Sample application illustrating usage of OAuth2 and Github for securing your application.

OAuth 2.0 is a security protocol used to protect systems and information. Websites and applications can use OAuth to allow users to sign into their applications and other people’s applications.

ASP.NET Core comes with OAuth authentication middleware which makes it easy to use a third party OAuth 2.0 server for login.

Many social websites provide an OAuth 2.0 service for public use such as Facebook, BitBucket, Stack Overflow, so it’s just a matter of adding them as an Identity Provider in your application.
